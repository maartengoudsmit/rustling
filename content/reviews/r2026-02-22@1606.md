I'm not a massive Star Trek guy, so I wasn't prepared to like its odd mixture of bonkers sci-fi quite as much as I did. Something I always appreciate about Star Trek is its dedication to diversity and to the notion that conflict is resolved through curiosity and empathy. Battles are won by the side that best understands what drives their adversary, rather than by strength. *Strange New Worlds* uses this backdrop to put the crew through wacky space adventures (body swap! pirates! medieval fantasy!) with surprising emotional beats that hit hard (for me, at least).
