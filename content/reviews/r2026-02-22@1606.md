I'm not a massive Star Trek guy, so I wasn't prepared to like the odd mixture of bonkers sci-fi in _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_ quite so much. Something I always appreciate about Star Trek is its dedication to diversity and to the notion that conflict is resolved through curiosity and empathy. Battles are won by the side that best understands what drives their adversary, rather than by strength. _Strange New Worlds_ uses this backdrop to put the crew through wacky space adventures (body swap! pirates! medieval fantasy!) with surprising emotional beats that hit hard (for me, at least). 🖖
