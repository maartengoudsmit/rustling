Welcome to my new blog. This is a place for longer thoughts and explorations.

## Why MDX?

MDX lets me write Markdown but also include custom components when I need them. This is perfect for:

- Interactive demos
- Custom callouts and asides
- Embedded widgets
- Anything else I dream up

## What's Next

I'll be writing about things that interest me—technology, nature, books, and the occasional random musing.

Stay tuned.
